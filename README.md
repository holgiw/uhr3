3. Smooth Minute and Train Station Modes
•	Smooth Minute Mode:
•	The minute hand moves smoothly instead of jumping in 1-minute increments.
•	Train Station Mode:
•	The second hand stops briefly at 60 seconds, mimicking a classic train station clock.
---
4. Brightness Control
•	Automatic brightness adjustment using a photoresistor.
•	Configurable thresholds for minimum and maximum brightness.

•	Adjusting brightness, time zone, and display rotation.
•	Enabling/disabling Smooth Minute and Train Station modes.
•	Viewing system status (e.g., WiFi details, storage usage, uptime).
---
7. File Management with LittleFS
•	Uses the LittleFS filesystem to:
•	Store custom clock faces and hands.
•	Manage files (e.g., upload, rename, delete).
---
8. Time Zone Customization
